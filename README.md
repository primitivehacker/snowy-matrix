Snowy Matrix aims to prevent avalanche victims by using generative AI to simulate avalanches and collect synthetic data. Due to the lack of avalanche events, building a good predictive model for avalanches is difficult without synthetic data. We can overcome that problem by simulating avalanches to generate valuable synthetic data.
